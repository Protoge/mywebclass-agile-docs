Task 5
Task Title: Set up Google Analytics Account and Tracking Code

User Story: As a team member, I want to ensure that we use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site, so that we can improve the website and better understand user needs.

Description: In order to track user behavior on the website, we need to set up a Google Analytics account and add the tracking code to the website. The tracking code should be added to all relevant pages on the website, and configured to track relevant user behavior such as pageviews, bounce rates, and user demographics. Acceptance criteria include successful creation of a Google Analytics account, successful installation of the tracking code on all relevant pages of the website, and successful configuration of the tracking code to track relevant user behavior.

Effort Estimate: 4 hours

Assigned To: Web Developer

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes: This task may be dependent on completion of Task 2 (Add team members as collaborators to the repository), as it may require access to the website's codebase. Additionally, team members responsible for user data privacy (e.g. Data Protection Officer) should be consulted to ensure that data collection complies with legal requirements such as GDPR.
