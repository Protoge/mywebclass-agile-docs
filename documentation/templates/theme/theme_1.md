Theme 1
"As a user, I want to access a user-friendly and visually appealing website template that meets legal requirements and allows for the use of Google Analytics so that I can measure user behavior and improve the user experience. By creating a basic web template that satisfies these requirements, we can launch MyWebClass.org and provide a strong foundation for future development. This will enable us to establish an online presence and attract potential users. By following the principles of Agile and Lean, we can quickly and effectively develop the website template, set up a DevOps process, and establish a culture of continuous improvement. The project deliverables include a website template that passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner, and basic on-page SEO requirements. This will set us up for long-term success by providing a solid foundation for future development and enabling us to improve the user experience over time."

You can fill in the placeholders with your own information to create a complete agile theme that outlines your project objectives, outcomes, and deliverables.
